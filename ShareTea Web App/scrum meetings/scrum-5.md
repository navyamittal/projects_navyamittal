## Minutes from Previous Meeting
In our previous meeting we discussed how we planned to implement Sprint 2. We talked about which parts of the User Study stood out to us, and how we planned to make our website better for Sprint 2. This included changing the name of “Order” to “Cart”, a relatively simple change that made our website more intuitive. We also discussed task assignments for Sprint 2, which were listed in the Task Table. In the previous meeting, we also planned the second Sprint meeting (this current meeting) to be before we finished all of our assignments for the Sprint so we could check in and help each other with problems.
