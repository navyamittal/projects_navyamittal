## Minutes from Previous Meeting
In our previous scrum meeting, we discussed our html designs (that we are using for a hi-fi wireframe).  We also discussed what we had already completed (the basic database and design document), and how those related to the requirements for Project 3. We decided to first work on connecting to the database as shown in the lab slides  and creating the individual pages using .ejs. Going forward, we also planned on implementing the different pages by transferring them into .ejs from the .html and hooking them up with the psql database.
