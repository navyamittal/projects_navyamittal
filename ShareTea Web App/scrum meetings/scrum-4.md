## Minutes from Previous Meeting
In our previous meeting we discussed that we were done with Sprint 1. We talked about what we still had to do going forward. We decided that for Sprint 1, all we had left was the Sprint 1 Materials document and the user study. As we move into Sprint 2, we talked about having to create the Sprint 2 Backlog. We also discussed distribution of labor and how we will continue going forward in our roles.
