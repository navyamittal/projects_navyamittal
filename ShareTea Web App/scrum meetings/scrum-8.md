## Minutes from Previous Meeting
In the previous meeting, we started working on our sprint 3 assignments. We had finished making the Sprint 3 backlog as well as updating our overall product backlog. A roadblock that we encountered was that we realized that we had a lot more to do in terms of functionality and fixing small bugs that were found through the expert user panel report. This resulted in more user stories being added to our sprint backlog. We decided on our first sprint 3 assignments.
