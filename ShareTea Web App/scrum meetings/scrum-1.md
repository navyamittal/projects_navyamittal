## Minutes from Previous Meeting
First scrum meeting, so there was no previous meeting. Prior to this meeting, we had (non-scrum) discussions about the changing of roles. Jocelyn is now the project manager, Navya and Christi are front-end, and Bonnie and Rhea are back-end.  We also created the project design document with our plans going forward.
