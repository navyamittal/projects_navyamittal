## Minutes from Previous Meeting
In our previous meeting we discussed our tasks going forward. After the scrum meeting, we planned on making our presentation and then recording it. We discussed what we still had to do for the sprint (including the deployment and GitHub release). We also discussed what we had already completed, that is, connecting the pages to the database locally and converting all the pages to .ejs. We also updated the pages, including the employee login page. In particular, the home page was updated to contain more information. We also discussed the due date for Sprint 1 and what work we had to do to be done with the Sprint by Wednesday (today).
