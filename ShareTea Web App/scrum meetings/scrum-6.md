## Minutes from Previous Meeting
In our previous scrum meeting, we delved into the tasks for Sprint 2 that had been started. We made consistent progress and checked in on each other regarding the remaining tasks. No roadblocks were encountered, allowing us to focus on reviewing the progress made since our last meeting. These accomplishments encompassed the addition of customizations for ice and sugar, the implementation of a logout function, and the integration of the cart tab along with some frontend development. Looking ahead, our plan is to complete the outstanding tasks for Sprint 2 in preparation for our GitHub release. Additionally, we outlined responsibilities for the Sprint 2 Materials document.
