## Minutes from Previous Meeting
In our previous scrum meeting, we talked about our individual progress as it was the end of the second sprint. We each got a lot done since the last sprint, and so we also discussed what was still remaining to do for sprint 3. There were no roadblocks that we faced for the last meeting of sprint 2. We decided that for Sprint 3, we would focus a lot more on testing and debugging, while also continuously improving our front end and user-friendliness/intuitiveness. We decided to Finish our Github Release, Sprint 2 Materials doc, and update our product backlog in order to prepare for sprint 3.
